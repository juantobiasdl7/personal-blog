		Tobías De La Cruz is a driven technology professional who combines hands-on software development 
		with agile project leadership. 
		He holds a bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the National Polytechnic Institute and
		he’s currently studying Systems Engineering at the Virtual University 
		of the State of Guanajuato.
	</p>
	<p>
		His core skills are in Python, Go, JavaScript, React, SQL and PostgreSQL, but he’s also comfortable 
		working with a wide range of other technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since April 2024, Tobías has been a Backend Developer at Optimen, where he builds and maintains the 
		primary API that delivers real-time flight status to the Volaris mobile app with 99.95% reliability. 
		He also handles change requests, performs operational data analysis for Volaris’s daily operations, 
		leads code reviews, and enforces best practices—always striving to close the gap between concept and 
		production.
	</p>
	<p>
		Before focusing full-time on coding, Tobías spent over three years as a technical project manager 
		leading digital initiatives for major airline clients. As a Certified Scrum Master, he guided the 
		end-to-end delivery of Viva Aerobus’s e-commerce and mobile platforms, collaborated in the launch 
		of a loyalty program that gained more than 3.4 million members in under a year, and integrated 
		multiple payment gateways to boost customer experience. He focuses on turning business goals into 
		clear technical plans saved teams time, cut defects, and fostered stronger collaboration across 
		multidisciplinary teams.
