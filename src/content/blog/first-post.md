I’ve closed almost all of my social media accounts—no Facebook, no Instagram, no X. There’s just too much noise in the world.

I want to write more and create more.

I’ve been studying mathematics with MathAcademy since September 11 of last year.

And, just for fun, I thought I’d build something similar called PhysicsAcademy.

I think it’s a great idea, and I’ll share more about it in the coming days.
